# Grafeo-dSTORM-analysis-

Grafeo program will be uploded this week ...
Grafeo is a matlab-based program for analysis of one or two color 2D or 3D dSTORM data. It works on molecular coordinate list. Grafeo is compatible with Nikon N-STORM molecular list txt files and in near future will be extended to work with Zeiss or Leica STORM files. Grafeo analysis is based on multiple approaches e.g. Voronoi diagrams, Delaunay triangulation, Ripley's function.
