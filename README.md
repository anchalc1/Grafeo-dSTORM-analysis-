Grafeo is Matlab based program for the analysis of a single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) data e.g. dSTORM or PALM. It works on a single molecule coordinates rather than pixelated images. Grafeo uses various pointillist approaches previously described in the literature, e.g. Voronoi Tessellation, Delaunay Triangulation, Ripleyâ€™s function. Grafeo does not pretend to be the first to apply these functions for the single molecule data. It was developed to cope with huge amount of data to work in the batch processing mode,. Grafeo was published in Haas et al., 'Single-molecule localization microscopy reveals molecular transactions during RAD51 filament assembly at cellular
DNA damage sites',  Nucleic Acids Research, 2018,gkx1303, https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkx1303
Grafeo v1beta and its manual are far from being ideal. All the errors and inconsistencies will be corrected in the future releases. More functionalities will be added in the future release.
